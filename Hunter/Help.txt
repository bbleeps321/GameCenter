Description:
Take careful aim and destroy the targets moving 
on the stage. Each successive level may make the 
targets faster. Beware! Your ammunition for each 
level is limited and if you run out, you lose.

How to play Hunter:
Aim the center of the crosshairs and left-click
with the mouse to fire. As you progress, you'll 
gain weapons with different bonuses.
